Installing the R source rgdal package

In order to install the R source rgdal package, you should first have
installed GDAL/OGR with all of their dependencies needed for the data
you need to access. There are many dependencies, not all of which need to
be met for every user, but which provide the flexibility needed by users
with special requirements. Note that both driver updates and new drivers
are made available in successive releases of GDAL/OGR, and that, for
special purposes, tracking the GDAL/OGR CVS changes can be very useful.

The main download source is:

http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadSource

PROJ.4 is available at:

http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/

but installing FWTools is a convenient way to get started (but will
be limited to the - extensive - range of drivers built into the binary
package):

http://fwtools.maptools.org/

If installing PROJ.4 from RPM binaries, note that three RPM files
are required: "proj", "proj-devel", and "proj-nad". The third file,
"proj-nad", contains all of the support files placed in /usr/share/proj,
and is required for any use of "proj" itself.

Debian users appear to get all of the required files (libraries, binaries,
support files and headers) in the "proj" package, although some package
lists seem to omit NAD binaries, for example /usr/share/proj/conus,
which if missing will provoke a warning under ./configure.

For OSX users, either install PROJ.4 and GDAL/OGR from source, then
install the rgdal source package, or use the comprehensive frameworks
provided by William Kyngesburye:

Either simply install the GDAL framework and all of its dependencies,
then install the rgdal source package from the command line:

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="" rgdal_*.tar.gz

with the correct configure-args for your platform, or install the GDAL
framework with dependencies first, then an rgdal binary from the same
site.
